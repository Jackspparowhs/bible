/* --------------------- */
`IN THE BEGINNING did the Heavens open,
and the Breath of the Almighty moved upon the Quiet Deep.

And the Void was still; and Silence draped the face of the waters.

And there came forth a Whisper, saying,
“Let Light be born.” 
And behold — a glow like dawn rose upon the shadowed nothingness.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 2              */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Light parted the darkness,
and the darkness fled from before it.

And the Almighty beheld the Light,
that it carried goodness within it.

Thus was the First Day numbered,
and the stars yet slept in the cradle of the heavens.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 3              */
/* --------------------- */
`And upon the Second Day,
the Breath of the Most High stretched forth,
dividing the Waters from the Waters.

And a great expanse was lifted up,
and the lower waters rested beneath,
and the upper waters shimmered like crystal above.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 4              */
/* --------------------- */
`And upon the Third Day,
He gathered the Waters of the earth together,
that the dry land might appear.

And it rose like an island from the deep,
and grass clothed the fields,
and herbs burst forth with seed,
each after their kind.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 5              */
/* --------------------- */
`And upon the Fourth Day,
the heavens awakened with signs and lights.

The greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to comfort the night.

And the stars — countless and bright —
were scattered like jewels upon velvet darkness.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 6              */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Fifth Day was filled with motion,
for the waters brought forth creatures in abundance,
and the skies were filled with winged fowl.

And the Almighty blessed them, saying:
Be fruitful, and multiply,
and fill the seas and the heavens.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 7              */
/* --------------------- */
`And upon the Sixth Day,
living beings walked upon the land:
beasts, and cattle, and creeping things,
each after their kind.

And last of all,
He formed Man from the dust,
and breathed into him a living soul.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 8              */
/* --------------------- */
`And Man opened his eyes,
and beheld the garden prepared for him —
a place of rivers, and gold, and precious stone.

And the Almighty walked with him
in the cool of the day,
and all was peace.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 9              */
/* --------------------- */
`But a shadow stirred at the edge of the garden,
and the serpent, subtle among all creatures,
whispered craftily beneath the leaves.

And the woman heard,
and pondered the words that dripped like honey,
yet carried venom hidden within.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 10             */
/* --------------------- */
`And thus began the trial of mankind,
for choice was given unto them —
life or death,
obedience or wanderings.

And the story of their generations
was written from that hour forth.`

  /* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 11             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the woman stood before the tree,
whose fruit glimmered softly in the shade.
And the serpent spoke a second time, saying:
“Ye shall not surely die.”

And her heart wavered, for the promise
seemed sweet in her ears.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 12             */
/* --------------------- */
`And she took of the fruit thereof,
and gave unto the man beside her.
And their eyes were opened,
and they beheld that innocence was gone.

And shame clothed them heavier
than any garment they could fashion.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 13             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the voice of the Almighty called unto them,
walking in the cool of the day.

And the man hid himself among the trees,
and fear covered him like dust upon the ground.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 14             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Almighty said:
“Where art thou?”

And the man answered:
“I heard Thy voice,
and I was afraid.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 15             */
/* --------------------- */
`Then judgment was declared upon the serpent,
upon the woman,
and upon the man.

Yet even in judgment,
mercy was woven like thread of gold
through the decree of the Most High.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 16             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the garden was closed,
and a flaming sword turned every way,
guarding the path unto the Tree of Life.

And the first sorrow of mankind
was written upon the earth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 17             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the woman bore a son,
even Cain,
and she said:
“I have gotten a man from the Lord.”

And afterwards came Abel,
a keeper of sheep,
gentle and humble of heart.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 18             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Cain brought of the fruit of the ground,
yet Abel brought the firstlings of his flock,
pure and without blemish.

And the Almighty regarded Abel’s offering,
but Cain’s offering He regarded not.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 19             */
/* --------------------- */
`And envy rose within Cain,
dark as storm clouds.

And the Almighty spoke unto him, saying:
“If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?”

But wrath shut Cain’s ears,
and jealousy hardened his heart.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 20             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him in the field.

And the earth opened its mouth
to receive the blood of the innocent,
crying out unto the heavens.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 21             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Almighty said unto Cain:
“What hast thou done?”

And Cain trembled, saying,
“My punishment is greater than I can bear.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 22             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord,
and dwelt in the land of wandering.

And a mark was set upon him,
that no man should slay him,
lest sevenfold vengeance fall upon the slayer.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 23             */
/* --------------------- */
`And generations rose from his line,
builders of cities,
players of instruments,
workers of brass and iron.

Yet violence and pride
walked beside them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 24             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Adam knew his wife again,
and a son was born,
and she called his name Seth.

For the Almighty had appointed
another seed in place of Abel,
whom Cain slew.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 25             */
/* --------------------- */
`And from Seth came Enos,
and in those days
men began to call upon the name of the Lord
with reverence and trembling.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 26             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the generations of Adam were these:
men of long years,
whose days stretched like the dawn,
and whose footsteps echoed through the early earth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 27             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Enoch walked with God;
and he was not,
for God took him.

And a whisper of wonder
spread across the lands,
for the heavens had received a man.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 28             */
/* --------------------- */
`And violence increased upon the earth,
and cruelty multiplied.

And the Almighty beheld
that every imagination of man’s heart
was filled with corruption continually.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 29             */
/* --------------------- */
`But Noah found grace
in the eyes of the Lord.

A just man,
upright in his generations,
who walked not in the ways of violence.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 30             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Almighty spoke unto Noah, saying:
“The end of all flesh is come before Me,
for the earth is filled with violence.”

And thus the command was given
to build the Ark upon the hills,
for a flood was appointed from the heavens.`

  /* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 31             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah prepared the Ark
according to the pattern given unto him,
with rooms fashioned within,
and pitch sealing it without and within.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 32             */
/* --------------------- */
`Three stories he built,
strong and steadfast,
and a door set in the side thereof.

And Noah labored with patience,
though the world mocked him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 33             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Almighty said:
“Of every living creature of all flesh,
two of every sort shalt thou bring into the Ark,
to keep them alive with thee.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 34             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the beasts of the field,
and the creeping things of the earth,
and the fowls of the air descended
by the command of the Most High,
unto Noah’s dwelling.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 35             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah gathered food of every kind,
for himself,
for his household,
and for the creatures that would dwell within the Ark.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 36             */
/* --------------------- */
`And when the appointed day drew near,
the heavens grew dark,
and a silence lay upon the earth,
as though creation held its breath.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 37             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah entered the Ark,
and his sons,
and his wife,
and the wives of his sons with him.

And the Lord shut him in.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 38             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the fountains of the great deep burst forth,
and the windows of heaven were opened,
and rain fell upon the earth
forty days and forty nights.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 39             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the waters prevailed exceedingly,
and lifted up the Ark,
and it rose above the mountains of the earth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 40             */
/* --------------------- */
`And all flesh died that moved upon the earth,
and every hill under the whole heaven
was covered with the waters.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 41             */
/* --------------------- */
`Only Noah remained alive,
and they that were with him in the Ark.

And the great silence of the deep
covered the earth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 42             */
/* --------------------- */
`And God remembered Noah,
and caused a wind to pass over the earth,
and the waters began to retreat.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 43             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat,
and in the tenth month
the tops of the mountains were seen.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 44             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah sent forth a raven,
which went to and fro
until the waters were dried from the earth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 45             */
/* --------------------- */
`Then he sent forth a dove,
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot,
and returned unto him into the Ark.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 46             */
/* --------------------- */
`And after seven days,
Noah sent the dove again,
and she returned with an olive leaf
plucked in her beak.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 47             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah knew
that the waters were abated from the earth.

And hope blossomed anew
upon the face of the world.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 48             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah went forth from the Ark,
and his household with him,
and every living thing that came forth from the vessel.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 49             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah built an altar unto the Lord,
and offered burnt offerings
of every clean beast and of every clean fowl.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 50             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord smelled a sweet savor,
and said in His heart:
“I will not again curse the ground for man's sake.”`

  /* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 51             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord blessed Noah
and his sons,
and said unto them:
“Be fruitful, and multiply,
and replenish the earth.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 52             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the fear of man
fell upon every beast of the earth,
and upon every fowl of the air,
and upon all that moveth upon the ground.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 53             */
/* --------------------- */
`Every moving thing that liveth
shall be meat for you;
even as the green herb
have I given you all things.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 54             */
/* --------------------- */
`But flesh with the life thereof,
which is the blood thereof,
ye shall not eat.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 55             */
/* --------------------- */
`And surely your blood of your lives
will I require:
at the hand of every beast will I require it,
and at the hand of man.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 56             */
/* --------------------- */
`Whoso sheddeth man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed:
for in the image of God made He man.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 57             */
/* --------------------- */
`And God spake unto Noah,
and to his sons with him, saying,`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 58             */
/* --------------------- */
`“I establish My covenant with you,
and with your seed after you,
and with every living creature
that is with you.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 59             */
/* --------------------- */
`Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more
by the waters of a flood;
neither shall there any more be a flood
to destroy the earth.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 60             */
/* --------------------- */
`And God said:
“This is the token of the covenant
which I make between Me and you,
and every living creature.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 61             */
/* --------------------- */
`I do set My bow in the cloud,
and it shall be for a token
of a covenant between Me and the earth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 62             */
/* --------------------- */
`And it shall come to pass,
when I bring a cloud over the earth,
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 63             */
/* --------------------- */
`And I will remember My covenant,
that the waters shall no more become a flood
to destroy all flesh.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 64             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the sons of Noah
that went forth of the Ark
were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 65             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah planted a vineyard,
and drank of the wine,
and was drunken;
and he lay uncovered within his tent.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 66             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Ham, the father of Canaan,
saw the nakedness of his father,
and told his two brethren without.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 67             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Shem and Japheth
took a garment,
and laid it upon their shoulders,
and walked backward,
and covered the nakedness of their father.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 68             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Noah awoke from his wine,
and knew what his younger son had done unto him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 69             */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“Cursed be Canaan;
a servant of servants
shall he be unto his brethren.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 70             */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“Blessed be the Lord God of Shem;
and Canaan shall be his servant.
God shall enlarge Japheth.”`

  /* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 71             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the whole earth
was of one language,
and of one speech.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 72             */
/* --------------------- */
`And it came to pass,
as they journeyed from the east,
that they found a plain
in the land of Shinar;
and they dwelt there.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 73             */
/* --------------------- */
`And they said one to another,
“Go to, let us make brick,
and burn them thoroughly.”
And they had brick for stone,
and slime had they for mortar.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 74             */
/* --------------------- */
`And they said,
“Let us build us a city
and a tower,
whose top may reach unto heaven;
and let us make us a name,
lest we be scattered abroad
upon the face of the whole earth.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 75             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord came down
to see the city and the tower,
which the children of men builded.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 76             */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord said,
“Behold, the people is one,
and they have all one language;
and this they begin to do.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 77             */
/* --------------------- */
`“And now nothing will be restrained from them,
which they have imagined to do.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 78             */
/* --------------------- */
`“Go to, let Us go down,
and there confound their language,
that they may not understand
one another’s speech.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 79             */
/* --------------------- */
`So the Lord scattered them abroad
from thence upon the face
of all the earth:
and they left off
to build the city.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 80             */
/* --------------------- */
`Therefore is the name of it called Babel;
because the Lord did confound
the language of all the earth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 81             */
/* --------------------- */
`These are the generations of Shem:
Shem was an hundred years old,
and begat Arphaxad
two years after the flood.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 82             */
/* --------------------- */
`And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad
five hundred years,
and begat sons and daughters.`,

`And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years,
and begat Salah.`,

`And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah
four hundred and three years,
and begat sons and daughters.`,

`And Salah lived thirty years,
and begat Eber.`,

four hundred and three years,
and begat sons and daughters.`,

and begat Peleg.`,

four hundred and thirty years,
and begat sons and daughters.`,

`And Peleg lived thirty years,
and begat Reu.`,

two hundred and nine years,

`“Behold now,
I know that thou art a fair woman

between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle

`Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan,

`But the men of Sodom were wicked

`And the Lord said unto Abram,
after that Lot was separated from him,

northward, and southward,

to the mountain.`,

“Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
let us make him drink wine this night also;
and go thou in, and lie with him,
that we may preserve seed of our father.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 302            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they made their father drink wine that night also:
and the younger arose, and lay with him;
and he perceived not when she lay down,
nor when she arose.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 303            */
/* --------------------- */
`Thus were both the daughters of Lot
with child by their father.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 304            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the first born bare a son,
and called his name Moab:
the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 305            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the younger,
she also bare a son,
and called his name Benammi:
the same is the father of the children of Ammon
unto this day.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 306            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur,
and sojourned in Gerar.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 307            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham said of Sarah his wife,
“She is my sister”:
and Abimelech king of Gerar sent,
and took Sarah.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 308            */
/* --------------------- */
`But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night,
and said to him,
“Behold, thou art but a dead man,
for the woman which thou hast taken;
for she is a man’s wife.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 309            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Abimelech had not come near her:
and he said,
“Lord, wilt Thou slay also a righteous nation?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 310            */
/* --------------------- */
`“Said he not unto me,
She is my sister?
and she, even she herself said,
He is my brother:
in the integrity of my heart
and innocency of my hands
have I done this.”`,

  /* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 311            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the children of the east
came wandering by the borders,
seeking pasture for their flocks,
for the land before them was wide.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 312            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham looked upon them,
and his heart was moved with kindness,
for he remembered the days
when he himself was a stranger
journeying through strange lands.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 313            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he gave them water to drink,
and bread for their young ones,
and they blessed the name of the Lord
for His mercies that endure forever.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 314            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then rose the morning sun,
casting long shadows upon the hills,
and the travelers took their journey onward,
lifting their eyes unto heaven.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 315            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham returned to his tent,
and the Lord spake unto him, saying,
“Fear not, for I am thy shield,
and thy reward shall be exceeding great.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 316            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham fell upon his face
and worshipped,
for the voice of the Lord
was strength unto his bones.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 317            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord said unto him,
“As the stars of heaven are without number,
so shall thy seed be,
and no man shall diminish it.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 318            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham believed the Lord,
and it was counted unto him
for righteousness.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 319            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Sarah heard these things from the tent,
and she wondered in her heart,
saying, “Shall such joy be granted unto me,
seeing I am old?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 320            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord said,
“Is anything too hard for the Lord?
In the appointed season
thou shalt rejoice.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 321            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then Sarah bowed her face
and hid her tears,
for she felt the stirring of hope,
though she spake it not aloud.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 322            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord departed from them,
and Abraham stood in the plain
and watched until the glory faded
from his sight.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 323            */
/* --------------------- */
`And in those days
the herds of Abraham multiplied greatly,
and the land prospered under his care.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 324            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the servants said,
“The hand of the Lord is upon our master,
and there is none like him
in all the land.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 325            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Abraham answered them,
“Boast not in me,
for all flesh is grass,
but glory belongeth unto God alone.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 326            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he built an altar
on the high place,
and offered thanksgiving unto the Lord.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 327            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the smoke rose upward,
a sweet savour before heaven,
and Abraham bowed
until his forehead touched the earth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 328            */
/* --------------------- */
`And in the stillness of the morning,
the Lord visited him again,
and spoke words of peace
unto his heart.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 329            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham said,
“Lord, guide my steps,
that I may walk uprightly
all the days of my habitation.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 330            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord answered,
“My covenant standeth forever,
and my words shall not fall to the ground.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 331            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then Abraham lifted his eyes,
and behold, three strangers
stood afar off upon the hill.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 332            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he ran to meet them,
and bowed himself to the earth,
for he perceived a divine presence.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 333            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“Turn in, I pray you,
and rest under the shade,
and take bread for your strength.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 334            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they answered,
“Do as thou hast said,”
and Abraham hastened into the tent.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 335            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Sarah prepared fine meal,
and kneaded it,
and made cakes upon the hearth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 336            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham set it before the guests,
and stood by them under the tree
as they did eat.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 337            */
/* --------------------- */
`And one of them said,
“Surely thou shalt be blessed above men,
for thy heart is steadfast.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 338            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham trembled,
for he knew the voice
was not of mortal tongue.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 339            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the stranger continued,
“Sarah thy wife shall bear a son,
and thou shalt call his name Isaac.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 340            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Sarah heard,
and laughed within herself,
saying, “Shall a woman worn with years
bring forth a child?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 341            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord said,
“Wherefore did Sarah laugh?
Behold, I shall perform
that which I have spoken.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 342            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Sarah denied, saying,
“I laughed not,”
for she was afraid.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 343            */
/* --------------------- */
`But the Lord answered,
“Nay, but thou didst laugh,”
and she bowed herself in shame.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 344            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the strangers rose up
and looked toward the valley,
and Abraham walked with them
to bring them on their way.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 345            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord said,
“Shall I hide from Abraham
that thing which I do?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 346            */
/* --------------------- */
`For the cry of the cities was great,
and their wickedness
had reached unto heaven.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 347            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham said,
“Shall not the Judge of all the earth
do right?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 348            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord answered him with mercy,
for Abraham walked in uprightness.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham returned to his place,
and Sarah pondered the words
in her heart.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And the days passed,
and the promise grew nearer.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 351            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord visited Sarah
as He had spoken,
and she conceived in the time appointed.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 352            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she brought forth a son,
and Abraham called his name Isaac,
according to the word of the Lord.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 353            */
/* --------------------- */
`And joy filled the household,
and laughter was heard
from morning until evening.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham made a great feast
the day Isaac was weaned.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 355            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Ishmael mocked,
and Sarah saw it,
and her countenance fell.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 356            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she said unto Abraham,
“Cast out the bondwoman and her son,
for he shall not be heir
with my son Isaac.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 357            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the thing was grievous
in Abraham’s sight,
for Ishmael was his son.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 358            */
/* --------------------- */
`But God said,
“Let it not be grievous in thy sight;
for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 359            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham rose early,
and sent Hagar and her son away
with bread and a bottle of water.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 360            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they wandered in the wilderness,
until the water was spent,
and the child fainted.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 361            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Hagar lifted up her voice and wept,
for she feared the child would die.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 362            */
/* --------------------- */
`But the angel of God called unto her,
saying, “Fear not,
for God hath heard the voice of the lad.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 363            */
/* --------------------- */
`And God opened her eyes,
and she saw a well of water,
and gave the lad drink.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 364            */
/* --------------------- */
`And God was with the lad,
and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness,
and became a skilled archer.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 365            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham dwelt in the plains,
and the Lord prospered him
all his days.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 366            */
/* --------------------- */
`And it came to pass
after these things,
that God did try Abraham,
to prove what was in his heart.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 367            */
/* --------------------- */
`And He said,
“Abraham.”  
And he answered, “Here am I.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 368            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord said,
“Take now thy son,
thine only son Isaac,
and offer him upon a mount
that I will show thee.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 369            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham’s heart trembled,
yet he withheld not obedience,
for he feared the Lord.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 370            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he rose early,
and took wood for the burnt offering,
and Isaac his son,
and two young men with him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 371            */
/* --------------------- */
`And on the third day,
Abraham lifted his eyes
and saw the place afar off.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 372            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said to the young men,
“Tarry ye here,
and I and the lad will go yonder
and worship.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 373            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Isaac spake unto Abraham,
“My father.”  
And he said, “Here am I, my son.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 374            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Isaac said,
“Behold the fire and the wood,
but where is the lamb
for a burnt offering?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 375            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham answered,
“My son, God will provide Himself a lamb.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 376            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they came to the place,
and Abraham built an altar there
and laid the wood in order.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 377            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he bound Isaac his son,
and laid him upon the altar.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 378            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham stretched forth his hand,
and took the knife
to slay his son.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 379            */
/* --------------------- */
`But the angel of the Lord
called unto him from heaven,
saying, “Abraham, Abraham!”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 380            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said, “Here am I.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 381            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the angel said,
“Lay not thine hand upon the lad,
for now I know
that thou fearest God.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 382            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham lifted his eyes,
and saw a ram caught in a thicket.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 383            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he took the ram
and offered it instead of his son.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And Abraham called the place
Jehovah-jireh:
as it is said to this day,
“In the mount of the Lord
it shall be seen.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 385            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the angel called unto Abraham
a second time,
saying,`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 386            */
/* --------------------- */
`“By Myself have I sworn,
that in blessing I will bless thee,
and in multiplying
I will multiply thy seed.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 387            */

`And Abraham returned with Isaac,
and his heart rejoiced greatly,
for the Lord was merciful.`,

`And Sarah beheld them coming,
and ran forth with tears,
for joy overflowed in her spirit.`,

`And Abraham built another altar,
and praised the Lord
with offerings of thanksgiving.`,

`And peace dwelt in their tents
for many days.`,

`And Sarah grew old in years,
full of goodness,
and her days were accomplished.`,

with great sorrow.`,

`And he sought a burying place,
and purchased the cave of Machpelah
from the sons of Heth.`,

to find a wife for Isaac
from among his own people.`,

his prayer was answered.`,

/* --------------------- */
`And Isaac built an altar there,
and called upon the name of the Lord.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 427            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Esau, his son,
was a cunning hunter,
a man of the field.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 428            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Jacob was a plain man,
dwelling in tents,
and quiet in spirit.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 429            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Isaac loved Esau,
for the venison he brought,
but Rebekah loved Jacob.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 430            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Esau came faint from the field,
and said to Jacob,
“Feed me, I pray thee,
for I am weary.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 431            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob said,
“Sell me this day thy birthright.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 432            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Esau said,
“Behold, I am at the point to die;
what profit shall this birthright be to me?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 433            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he sware unto Jacob,
and sold his birthright unto him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 434            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage,
and he ate and rose up:
thus Esau despised his birthright.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 435            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when Isaac was old,
and his eyes were dim,
he called Esau his son.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 436            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“My son, go hunt venison for me,
that my soul may bless thee
before I die.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 437            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Rebekah heard these words,
and she prepared meat for Jacob
as Isaac loved.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 438            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she clothed him
with Esau’s garments,
and put skins on his hands,
that he might appear hairy.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 439            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob came unto Isaac,
and Isaac said,
“Who art thou, my son?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 440            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob said,
“I am Esau thy firstborn.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 441            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Isaac wondered,
yet he ate the meat and blessed him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 442            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“God give thee of the dew of heaven,
and plenty of corn and wine.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 443            */
/* --------------------- */
`“Let people serve thee,
and nations bow down to thee.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 444            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob received the blessing
and departed from his father.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 445            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Esau returned
and brought the venison,
and learned what had happened.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 446            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Esau cried with a great and bitter cry,
saying, “Bless me, even me also,
O my father!”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 447            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Isaac trembled,
and said,
“Thy brother hath taken away thy blessing.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 448            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Esau lifted his voice and wept,
and his heart burned with anger.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 449            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said in his heart,
“After my father’s days,
I will slay Jacob my brother.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 450            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Rebekah warned Jacob,
and sent him unto Laban
in the land of Haran.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 451            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob fled,
and the sun set upon him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 452            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he lighted upon a certain place,
and lay down to sleep,
with stones for his pillow.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 453            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he dreamed,
and behold a ladder
set upon the earth,
and the top reached to heaven.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 454            */
/* --------------------- */
`And angels of God
ascended and descended upon it.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 455            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord stood above,
and said,
“I am the God of Abraham and Isaac.”`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`“The land whereon thou liest,
to thee will I give it,
and to thy seed.”`,

`“And thy seed shall be as the dust,
and all nations shall be blessed
in thee.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 458            */

`And Jacob awoke and said,
“Surely the Lord is in this place.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 459            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he called the place Bethel,
and vowed a vow unto the Lord.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 460            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob lifted his feet
and journeyed toward the east country.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 461            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he came to a well,
and behold Rachel came
with the sheep of her father.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 462            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob rolled the stone
from the well’s mouth,
and watered the flock.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 463            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he loved Rachel,
for she was fair and of good countenance.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 464            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Laban received Jacob
and brought him into his house.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 465            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,
and they seemed unto him
but a few days,
for the love he had for her.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 466            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Laban deceived Jacob,
and gave him Leah instead.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 467            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob said,
“Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with me?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 468            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Laban said,
“It must not be so in our country,
to give the younger before the firstborn.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 469            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob served yet seven more years
for Rachel his beloved.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 470            */
/* --------------------- */
`And God opened Leah’s womb,
and she bore sons unto Jacob.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 471            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Rachel wept,
for she was barren.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 472            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she prayed unto the Lord,
and God remembered her.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 473            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she conceived and bore a son,
and called his name Joseph.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 474            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob prospered,
and his flocks increased greatly.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 475            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Laban’s sons murmured,
saying, “Jacob hath taken all
that was our father’s.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 476            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord said unto Jacob,
“Return unto thy land,
for I am with thee.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 477            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob rose with his wives
and children and all that he possessed.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 478            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Laban pursued him,
but God warned Laban in a dream
not to harm Jacob.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 479            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they made a covenant,
and set up a pillar as witness.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 480            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob journeyed on,
and the angels of God met him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 481            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he called the place Mahanaim,
for he said, “This is God’s host.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 482            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob feared Esau,
for he remembered his brother’s anger.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 483            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he prayed,
“O God of my fathers,
deliver me from the hand of Esau.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 484            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he sent gifts before him,
hoping to appease his brother.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 485            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob was left alone,
and there wrestled a man with him
until the breaking of the day.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 486            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the man touched the hollow
of Jacob’s thigh,
and it was out of joint.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 487            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“Let me go, for the day breaketh.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 488            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob said,
“I will not let thee go
except thou bless me.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 489            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“Thy name shall no more be Jacob,
but Israel:
for as a prince hast thou power
with God and with men.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 490            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob called the place Peniel,
saying, “I have seen God face to face,
and my life is preserved.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 491            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob lifted his eyes
and saw Esau coming with four hundred men.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 492            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob bowed himself to the ground
seven times,
until he came near his brother.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 493            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Esau ran to meet him,
and embraced him,
and wept.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 494            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob said,
“Take, I pray thee, my blessing
that is brought to thee.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 495            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Esau took it,
and peace was between them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 496            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob journeyed to Succoth,
and built him a house.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 497            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord prospered him
in his dwellings.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 498            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the fear of God
fell upon the cities round about,
so that none pursued Jacob.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 499            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob built an altar,
and called it El-elohe-Israel.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 500            */
/* --------------------- */
`And God said unto Jacob,
“Arise, go to Bethel,
and dwell there.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 501            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob commanded his household
to put away strange gods,
and purify themselves.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 502            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they gave Jacob
their strange gods and earrings,
and he hid them under the oak.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob came to Bethel,
and built an altar there.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 504            */
/* --------------------- */
`And God appeared unto Jacob again,
and blessed him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 505            */
/* --------------------- */
`And He said unto him,
“Thy name is Israel:
a nation and a company of nations
shall be of thee.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 506            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the land which He gave
unto Abraham and Isaac,
He confirmed unto Jacob.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 507            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob set up a pillar
to mark the place
where God spake with him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 508            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they journeyed from Bethel,
and Rachel travailed in childbirth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 509            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Rachel died as she bore a son,
and Jacob called his name Benjamin.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 510            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob buried Rachel
in the way to Ephrath,
and set a pillar upon her grave.`,

  /* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 511            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Israel journeyed onward,
and spread his tents beyond the tower of Edar.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 512            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the days of his wanderings
were many, yet the Lord guided him
in all his paths.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 513            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Reuben went and lay with Bilhah,
his father’s concubine;
and Israel heard of it.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 514            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the sons of Jacob were twelve:
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,
Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin,
Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 515            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob came unto Isaac his father
in Mamre, which is Hebron,
where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 516            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the days of Isaac were one hundred
and fourscore years.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 517            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Isaac gave up the ghost,
and died, and was gathered unto his people.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 518            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Esau and Jacob his sons
buried him with honor and tears.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 519            */
/* --------------------- */
`And these are the generations of Esau,
who is Edom.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 520            */
/* --------------------- */
`Esau took wives of the daughters
of Canaan, and begat sons and daughters,
and his households increased.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 521            */
/* --------------------- */
`And his possessions were great,
so that the land could not bear both him
and Jacob together.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 522            */
/* --------------------- */
`Thus Esau departed unto Mount Seir,
and dwelt there among the Edomites.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 523            */
/* --------------------- */
`And kings reigned in Edom
before any king reigned over Israel.`,

`And Joseph, being seventeen years old,
kept the flock with his brethren.`,

/* --------------------- */
`And he brought unto his father
their evil report.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 526            */

`And Israel loved Joseph
more than all his children,
for he was the son of his old age.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 527            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he made him a coat
of many colors.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And when his brethren saw
that their father loved him more,
they hated him.`,

`And Joseph dreamed a dream,
and told it to his brethren:
and they hated him yet more.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field,
and my sheaf arose and stood upright,
and yours bowed down before mine.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 531            */

`And his brethren said,
“Shalt thou indeed reign over us?”`,

`And he dreamed yet another dream,
and told it unto his father and brethren.`,

/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“Behold, the sun and the moon
and eleven stars bowed down to me.”`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And his father rebuked him,
yet observed the saying in his heart.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And his brethren went to feed
their father’s flock in Shechem.`,

/* --------------------- */

`And Israel said unto Joseph,
“Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
with thy brethren.”`,

/* --------------------- */

`And a certain man found Joseph wandering,
for he was seeking his brethren.`,

`And he said, “They are departed hence,
for I heard them say,
‘Let us go to Dothan.’”`,

`And Joseph went after his brethren,
and found them in Dothan.`,

`And when they saw him afar off,
they conspired against him to slay him.`,

`And Reuben heard it,
and delivered him out of their hands,
saying, “Let us not kill him.”`,

`And they cast him into a pit,
for the pit was empty, there was no water.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 543            */
/* --------------------- */
`And a company of Ishmaelites
passed by with camels
bearing spices and balm.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 544            */

`And Judah said,
“What profit is it if we slay our brother?
Let us sell him to the Ishmaelites.”`,

`And they sold Joseph
for twenty pieces of silver.`,

`And the Ishmaelites brought him
down into Egypt.`,

`And Reuben returned unto the pit,
and Joseph was not there,
and he rent his clothes.`,

`And they took Joseph’s coat,
and dipped it in the blood of a goat.`,

unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh.`,

in Potiphar’s sight,

/*   PAGE 562            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they dreamed dreams,
each man in one night.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 563            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph interpreted their dreams,
saying, “Do not interpretations belong to God?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 564            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the butler’s dream was good;
the baker’s dream was evil.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 565            */
/* --------------------- */
`And on the third day
Pharaoh restored the butler
and hanged the baker.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 566            */
/* --------------------- */
`Yet the butler remembered not Joseph.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 567            */
/* --------------------- */
`And after two full years,
Pharaoh dreamed a dream.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 568            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he stood by the river,
and seven fat cows came up,
and fed in a meadow.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 569            */
/* --------------------- */
`And seven lean cows came up after them,
and devoured the fat ones.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 570            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh awoke,
and his spirit was troubled.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 571            */
/* --------------------- */
`And none of the magicians of Egypt
could interpret the dream.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 572            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then the butler remembered Joseph.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 573            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh sent and called Joseph
out of the dungeon.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 574            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph interpreted the dream,
saying, “God hath shown Pharaoh
what He is about to do.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 575            */
/* --------------------- */
`“Seven years of plenty shall come,
and seven years of famine after them.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 576            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh said,
“Can we find such a one as this,
a man in whom the Spirit of God is?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 577            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh made Joseph ruler
over all the land of Egypt.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 578            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph gathered corn
as the sand of the sea.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 579            */
/* --------------------- */
`And unto Joseph were born two sons,
Manasseh and Ephraim.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 580            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the seven years of plenty ended,
and the famine began.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 581            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the famine was sore
in all lands.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 582            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob heard that there was corn
in Egypt, and sent his sons to buy.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 583            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Benjamin he sent not,
lest mischief befall him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 584            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph knew his brethren,
but made himself strange unto them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 585            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph spake roughly to them,
and accused them of being spies.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 586            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he put Simeon in bonds
before their eyes.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 587            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he commanded that their sacks
be filled with corn,
and their money secretly returned.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 588            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when they found the money,
their hearts failed them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 589            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob refused to send Benjamin,
for he said,
“My son shall not go down with you.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 590            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the famine waxed sore,
and they returned unto Egypt
with Benjamin.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 591            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph lifted up his eyes,
and saw Benjamin his brother,
and yearned in his bowels.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 592            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph made a feast for them,
and gave Benjamin five times more
than the others.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 593            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph commanded the steward
to put his silver cup
in Benjamin’s sack.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 594            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the steward overtook them
and found the cup.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 595            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Judah pleaded for Benjamin,
offering himself in his stead.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 596            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then Joseph could not refrain himself,
and revealed his identity.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 597            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he wept aloud,
and embraced his brethren.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 598            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh commanded
that wagons be given
to bring Jacob into Egypt.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 599            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob arose
and came into Egypt,
and Joseph met him
and fell on his neck.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 600            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph nourished his father
and his brethren
with bread all their days.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 601            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob blessed Pharaoh,
and dwelt in the land of Goshen.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 602            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the people of Egypt
spent all their money for bread.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 603            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph bought all the land
for Pharaoh.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 604            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt
seventeen years.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 605            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob called Joseph,
and made him swear
to bury him in the land
of his fathers.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 606            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob blessed Ephraim and Manasseh,
setting Ephraim before Manasseh.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 607            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob blessed his sons,
every one according to his blessing.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 608            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Jacob charged them, saying,
“Bury me with Abraham and Isaac.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 609            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when Jacob made an end of commanding,
he gathered up his feet into the bed,
and yielded up the ghost.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 610            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph fell upon his father’s face,
and wept upon him,
and kissed him.`,

  /* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 611            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph commanded his servants
the physicians to embalm his father.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 612            */
/* --------------------- */
`And forty days were fulfilled for him,
for so are fulfilled the days
of those which are embalmed.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 613            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Egyptians mourned for him
threescore and ten days.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 614            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph went up
to bury his father,
and with him went all the servants
of Pharaoh.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 615            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they came unto the threshing floor
of Atad, and there they mourned
with a great and very sore lamentation.`,

`And his sons carried him
into the land of Canaan,
and buried him in the cave
of Machpelah.`,

/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph returned into Egypt,
he and his brethren.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 618            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when Joseph’s brethren saw
that their father was dead,
they feared Joseph would requite them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 619            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they said,
“We pray thee, forgive, we beseech thee,
the trespass of thy brethren.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 620            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph wept
when they spake unto him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 621            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph said unto them,
“Fear not: for am I in the place of God?”`,

`“Ye thought evil against me;
but God meant it unto good,
to save much people alive.”`,

he, and his father’s house.`,

`And Joseph lived an hundred
and ten years.`,

`And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children
of the third generation.`,

/* --------------------- */

`And Joseph said unto his brethren,
“I die: and God will surely visit you,
and bring you out of this land.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 628            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph took an oath of them,
saying, “Ye shall carry up my bones
from hence.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 629            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph died,
being an hundred and ten years old:
and they embalmed him,
and put him in a coffin in Egypt.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 630            */
/* --------------------- */
`Now these are the names
of the children of Israel,
which came into Egypt with Jacob.`,

/* --------------------- */
`Every man came with his household:
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah.`,

/* --------------------- */

`Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 633            */
/* --------------------- */
`Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 634            */
/* --------------------- */
`And all the souls that came out
of the loins of Jacob were seventy.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 635            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joseph died, and all his brethren,
and all that generation.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 636            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the children of Israel were fruitful,
and increased abundantly.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 637            */
/* --------------------- */
`And there arose a new king over Egypt,
which knew not Joseph.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 638            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he said,
“Behold, the people of Israel
are more and mightier than we.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 639            */
/* --------------------- */
`“Come on, let us deal wisely with them,
lest they multiply.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 640            */
/* --------------------- */
`Therefore they did set over them
taskmasters to afflict them
with their burdens.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 641            */
/* --------------------- */
`But the more they afflicted them,
the more they multiplied.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 642            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Egyptians made their lives bitter
with hard bondage.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 643            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh commanded
the Hebrew midwives
to slay the sons at birth.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 644            */
/* --------------------- */
`But the midwives feared God,
and saved the men children alive.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 645            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord dealt well
with the midwives,
and the people multiplied.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 646            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh charged all his people,
saying, “Every son that is born
ye shall cast into the river.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 647            */
/* --------------------- */
`And there went a man
of the house of Levi,
and took to wife a daughter of Levi.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 648            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the woman conceived
and bare a son:
and she saw he was a goodly child.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 649            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she hid him three months.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 650            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when she could not longer hide him,
she made an ark of bulrushes,
and laid the child therein.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 651            */
/* --------------------- */
`And his sister stood afar off,
to wit what would be done to him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 652            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the daughter of Pharaoh
came down to wash at the river.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 653            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she saw the ark among the reeds,
and sent her maid to fetch it.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 654            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when she opened it,
she saw the child: and behold,
the babe wept.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 655            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she had compassion on him,
and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 656            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter,
“Shall I go and call a nurse
of the Hebrew women?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 657            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her,
“Go.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 658            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the maid went and called
the child’s mother.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 659            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh’s daughter said,
“Nurse it for me, and I will give thee wages.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 660            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the child grew,
and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter,
and he became her son.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 661            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she called his name Moses,
and said, “Because I drew him out
of the water.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 662            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses grew,
and went out unto his brethren,
and looked on their burdens.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 663            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he spied an Egyptian
smiting an Hebrew.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 664            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he slew the Egyptian,
and hid him in the sand.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 665            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when Pharaoh heard,
he sought to slay Moses.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 666            */
/* --------------------- */
`But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh,
and dwelt in the land of Midian.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 667            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he sat down by a well.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 668            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the daughters of the priest of Midian
came to draw water.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 669            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses stood up and helped them,
and watered their flock.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 670            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses was content
to dwell with the man,
and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 671            */
/* --------------------- */
`And she bare him a son,
and he called his name Gershom.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 672            */
/* --------------------- */
`And it came to pass
in process of time,
that the king of Egypt died.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 673            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the children of Israel sighed
by reason of their bondage,
and their cry came up unto God.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 674            */
/* --------------------- */
`And God heard their groaning,
and remembered His covenant
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 675            */
/* --------------------- */
`And God looked upon the children of Israel,
and God had respect unto them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 676            */
/* --------------------- */
`Now Moses kept the flock
of Jethro his father-in-law.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 677            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the angel of the Lord
appeared unto him
in a flame of fire
out of the midst of a bush.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 678            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he looked, and behold,
the bush burned with fire,
and the bush was not consumed.`,

`And Moses said,
“I will turn aside
and see this great sight.”`,

/* --------------------- */
`And God called unto him
out of the midst of the bush,
and said, “Moses, Moses.”`,

`And he said, “Here am I.”`,

`And He said,
“Draw not nigh hither:
put off thy shoes,
for the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground.”`,

the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob.”`,

`And Moses hid his face,
for he was afraid to look upon God.`,

`And the Lord said,
“I have surely seen the affliction
of My people.”`,

`And Moses said,
“Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh?”`,

`And God said,
“Certainly I will be with thee.”`,

`And Moses said unto God,
“Behold, when I come unto the children
of Israel, and say unto them,
‘The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you,’
what shall I say unto them?”`,

`And God said unto Moses,
“I AM THAT I AM.”`,

“Thus shalt thou say unto the children

`And it came to pass, that at midnight
the Lord smote all the firstborn
in the land of Egypt.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 837            */
/* --------------------- */
`And there was a great cry in Egypt;
for there was not a house
where there was not one dead.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 838            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Pharaoh rose up in the night,
he, and all his servants.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 839            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he called for Moses and Aaron by night,
and said, “Rise up, get you forth.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 840            */
/* --------------------- */
`“And bless me also.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 841            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Egyptians were urgent
upon the people,
that they might send them out
of the land in haste.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 842            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the people took their dough
before it was leavened.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 843            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the children of Israel journeyed
from Rameses to Succoth,
about six hundred thousand on foot.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 844            */
/* --------------------- */
`And a mixed multitude went up also
with them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 845            */
/* --------------------- */
`Now the sojourning
of the children of Israel,
who dwelt in Egypt,
was four hundred and thirty years.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 846            */
/* --------------------- */
`And it came to pass,
that all the hosts of the Lord
went out from the land of Egypt.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 847            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying, “Sanctify unto Me
all the firstborn.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 848            */
/* --------------------- */
`“And it shall be when the Lord
shall bring thee into the land,
that thou shalt set apart
unto the Lord all that openeth the womb.”`,

/* --------------------- */

`And Moses said unto the people,
“Remember this day,
in which ye came out from Egypt.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 850            */

`And it shall be for a sign unto thee
upon thine hand,
and for a memorial between thine eyes.`,

`And it came to pass,
when Pharaoh had let the people go,
that God led them not
through the way of the Philistines.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 852            */
/* --------------------- */
`But God led the people about,
through the way of the wilderness
of the Red Sea.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 853            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses took the bones of Joseph
with him.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 854            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord went before them
by day in a pillar of a cloud,
and by night in a pillar of fire.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 855            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 856            */
/* --------------------- */
`“Speak unto the children of Israel,
that they turn and encamp
before Pi-hahiroth.”`,

`“For Pharaoh will say,
They are entangled in the land.”`,

`“And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart,
that he shall follow after them.”`,

/* --------------------- */

`And it was told the king of Egypt
that the people fled.`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`And he took six hundred chosen chariots,
and all the chariots of Egypt.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 861            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord hardened
the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,
and he pursued after the children of Israel.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 862            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the children of Israel
lifted up their eyes,
and behold, the Egyptians marched
after them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 863            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they were sore afraid.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 864            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses said unto the people,
“Fear ye not, stand still,
and see the salvation of the Lord.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 865            */
/* --------------------- */
`“For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today,
ye shall see them again no more
for ever.”`,

/* --------------------- */

`And the Lord said unto Moses,
“Wherefore criest thou unto Me?
Speak unto the children of Israel,
that they go forward.”`,

and stretch out thine hand
over the sea, and divide it.”`,

`And the angel of God,
which went before the camp of Israel,
removed and went behind them.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 869            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the pillar of the cloud
came between the camp of the Egyptians
and the camp of Israel.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 870            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses stretched out his hand
over the sea.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 871            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord caused the sea
to go back by a strong east wind
all that night.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 872            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the children of Israel
went into the midst of the sea
upon the dry ground.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 873            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Egyptians pursued,
and went in after them
to the midst of the sea.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 874            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord troubled
the host of the Egyptians.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 875            */
/* --------------------- */
`And took off their chariot wheels,
that they drave heavily.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 876            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Egyptians said,
“Let us flee from the face of Israel.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 877            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses stretched forth his hand
over the sea, and the sea returned.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 878            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the waters covered the chariots,
and the horsemen,
and all the host of Pharaoh.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 879            */
/* --------------------- */
`Thus the Lord saved Israel
that day out of the hand
of the Egyptians.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 880            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Israel saw the Egyptians dead
upon the sea shore.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 881            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then sang Moses and the children of Israel
this song unto the Lord.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 882            */
/* --------------------- */
`“The Lord is my strength and song,
and He is become my salvation.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 883            */
/* --------------------- */
`“The Lord is a man of war:
the Lord is His name.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 884            */
/* --------------------- */
`“Pharaoh's chariots and his host
hath He cast into the sea.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 885            */
/* --------------------- */
`“Thy right hand, O Lord,
is become glorious in power.”`,

/* --------------------- */

/* --------------------- */
`“Who is like unto Thee, O Lord,
glorious in holiness?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 887            */
/* --------------------- */
`So Moses brought Israel
from the Red Sea,
and they went out into the wilderness.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 888            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when they came to Marah,
they could not drink
of the waters of Marah,
for they were bitter.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 889            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the people murmured against Moses,
saying, “What shall we drink?”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 890            */
/* --------------------- */
`And he cried unto the Lord;
and the Lord shewed him a tree,
which when he cast into the waters,
the waters were made sweet.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 891            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they came to Elim,
where were twelve wells of water,
and threescore and ten palm trees.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 892            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they journeyed from Elim,
and came unto the wilderness of Sin.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 893            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the whole congregation
murmured against Moses and Aaron.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 894            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the Lord said,
“I will rain bread from heaven for you.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 895            */
/* --------------------- */
`And when the dew was gone up,
behold, upon the face of the wilderness
there lay a small round thing,
as small as the hoarfrost.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 896            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses said unto them,
“This is the bread
which the Lord hath given you to eat.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 897            */
/* --------------------- */
`And they called the name thereof Manna.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 898            */
/* --------------------- */
`And the house of Israel
did eat manna forty years.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 899            */
/* --------------------- */
`Then came Amalek,
and fought with Israel in Rephidim.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 900            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses said unto Joshua,
“Choose us out men,
and go out, fight with Amalek.”`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 901            */
/* --------------------- */
`And it came to pass,
when Moses held up his hand,
Israel prevailed.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 902            */
/* --------------------- */
`But when he let down his hand,
Amalek prevailed.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 903            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,
the one on the one side,
and the other on the other side.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 904            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Joshua discomfited Amalek
and his people with the edge of the sword.`,

/*   PAGE 905            */
/* --------------------- */
`And Moses built an altar,
and called the name of it
Jehovah-nissi.`,

`And Jethro heard
of all that God had done for Moses,
and for Israel His people.`,

`And Moses told his father in law
all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh.`,

`And Jethro rejoiced
for all the goodness
which the Lord had done to Israel.`,

`And Jethro said,
“Blessed be the Lord,
who hath delivered you
out of the hand of the Egyptians.”`,

`And Moses let his father in law depart;
and he went his way
into his own land.`,

  /* --------------------- */

`And the Lord God,
whose mercy endureth forever,
remembered His people,
and strengthened the hearts
of all who trusted in Him.`,

`For His righteousness goeth before Him,

unto all generations.`,

`And many that were heavy laden
found rest in His promises,
for the word of the Lord is sure.`,

`And they spake one to another,
saying, Truly the Lord is our Refuge,
and underneath are the everlasting arms.`,

`And the elders gathered,
and rehearsed all the mighty works
which the Lord had wrought among them.`,

`So the people humbled themselves,
and turned again unto the Lord
with fasting and prayer.`,

whose truth faileth not,
nor His compassion cease.`,

all who fall,
and raiseth up those
that be bowed down.`,

`And the children sang praises,
saying, Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God Almighty,
who was, and is,
and is to come.`,

marvellous things.`,

into their hands.`,

before their eyes.`,

for many days,
and the people dwelt safely
beneath their vines and fig trees.`,

`But the prophets warned them,
saying, Forget not the Lord thy God,
for prosperity bringeth temptation
to the careless heart.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 1332           */
/* --------------------- */
`And they wrote these words in a book,
that future generations
might learn wisdom
and walk in the fear of the Lord.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 1333           */
/* --------------------- */
`Now there arose a scribe,
skillful in the law,
who sought to gather the histories
of the kings and the prophets.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 1334           */
/* --------------------- */
`And he journeyed through all the land,
seeking scrolls ancient and hidden,
that the truth might be preserved
without corruption.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 1335           */
/* --------------------- */
`And the elders honored him greatly,
for they perceived the zeal of his heart,
and blessed him in the name
of the God of Israel.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 1336           */

`And the Lord prospered his labor,
so that no word was lost,
nor any prophecy forgotten
that had been spoken by holy men of old.`,

`Now in those days the harvest was plenty,
and the people rejoiced exceedingly,
offering the firstfruits
unto the Lord of the whole earth.`,

/*   PAGE 1338           */
/* --------------------- */
`And the priests sang psalms of thanksgiving,
and the Levites sounded with trumpets,
and the joy of the people
was heard afar off.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 1339           */
/* --------------------- */
`Then came a drought upon the land,
and the rivers failed,
and the fields brought forth little,
and many hearts were troubled.`,

/* --------------------- */
/*   PAGE 1340           */
/* --------------------- */

and cried unto the Lord,
and the heavens gave rain,
and the valleys blossomed once more.`,
